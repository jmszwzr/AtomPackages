## How to use?  
just  
  ```markdown
  @import "your_file"  
  ```
easy, right :)

## Refresh button  
Refresh button is now added at the right corner of preview.  
Clicking it will clear file caches and refresh the preview.  
It could be useful if you want to clear image cache. [#144](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/144) [#249](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/249)

## Configure images
```markdown  
@import "test.png" {width:"300px", height:"200px", title:"my title", alt:"my alt"}
```

## Import online files
For example:  
```markdown
@import "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/master/LICENSE.md"
```

## Import PDF file  
To import PDF file, you need to have [pdf2svg](extra.md) installed.  
Markdown Preview Enhanced supports importing both local and online PDF files.  
However, it is not recommended to import large PDF files.  
For example:
```markdown
@import "test.pdf"
```

### PDF configuration
* **page_no**  
Display the `nth` page of PDF. 1-based indexing. For example `{page_no:1}` will display the 1st page of pdf.  
* **page_begin**, **page_end**  
Inclusive. For example `{page_begin:2, page_end:4}` will display the number 2, 3, 4 pages.

## Force to render Code Block  
```markdown
@import "test.puml" {code_block:true, class:"lineNo"}
@import "test.py" {class:"lineNo"}
```

## Import file as Code Chunk  
```markdown
@import "test.py" {code_chunk:true, cmd:"python3"}
```

## Known issues  
* importing other docs might break scroll sync functionality.  
* code chunk might be buggy.
